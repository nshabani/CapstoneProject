# Udacity Data Science NanoDegree Capstone Project-Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services

In this project, I analyzed demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, compared it against demographics information for the general population. I used unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identified the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, I applied what I learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and used a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that I used has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.
